## Translation
### Step 1: checking
1. [Check if the language isn't already in open ticket!](/language/)
2. Check if the current translation is up-to-date!
3. Can you edit/write JSON?

If there is translation missing & you can write json, then go to the next step!

### Step 2: translating
**RULES:**
- Always upload or create a pull request to the [__`dev` branch!__](https://github.com/DJj123dj/open-ticket/tree/dev)
- Don't change anything else, except the translation you are adding!
- Translations are checked before uploading, so don't write things that aren't specified in the json file
- Always start translating from `english.json` or `custom.json`! Never from another language.

If you translate, you need to change 2 files! The first one is required, the other 2 are optional & will be added by us if you don't do it!
1. add `yourlanguage.json` to the `/language/` directory
2. add your username to the `_CREDITS` part of `yourlanguage.json`!
3. add your discord username in the translator table in `README.md`

### Step 3: waiting
Translations will always be added in the **next version** of Open Ticket! They will never be added to the `main` branch directly without anything else! This means that it can take some time before your translation is in the official version!

## Writing plugins
We are going to create an official repository for plugins soon!
But don't worry! You can already write some plugins!

**RULES:**
- Always specify the versions that the plugin is compatible with!
- If extra npm dependencies are needed, then they also need to be specified!
- If there are errors while you write a plugin/edit the code in some way. Then we can't help you with fixing the bug. We only fix bugs that are part of the original unedited version of Open Ticket!
